# Overview
This work is part of the exam of *Human Computer Interaction* by Prof. *Andrew D. Bagdanov* in Laurea Magistrale in Ingegneria Informatica at University of Florence.
- Academic Year: 2021/2022
- Project Title: A WebApp redesign of the referee view of FIPOnline system
- Student: Kevin Maggi
- CFUs: 9

In this project I will redesign the referee personal areas of FIPOnline system, the web system of FIP (Italian Federation of Basketball) for managing match designation, reimbursement request, annual sign-up, matches history and personal registry. I will convert the actual (2021) only-desktop, counterintuitive and hardly usable "web app" into a real user-friendly, responsive and accessible Progressive Web App.

# Tool & Techniques
The main tools and techniques I will employ are:
- Vue.js / Vue Router
- Material Design guidelines
- Bootstrap
- ARIA guidelines for accessibility

# Expected Outcomes
I expected to obtain, through a process of needfinding, prototyping and usability testing, a (prototype of) real Progressive Web App fully usable in mobility, like the referee's daylife usually requests. In particular with the final usability test phase will be interesting to highlight the possible strenghts and weak points of the resulting web app, along with ideas for future developments.
